## Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.

```
let myAge = 28;

var earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;

let laterYears = myAge - 2;
laterYears *= 4;

console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);

let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
console.log(myAgeInDogYears);

let myName = 'Abe Ahn'.toLowerCase();
```
